# Number-Guesser

Welcome to the Number Guessing Game! This is a simple command-line game where you try to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 200.

## How to Play

1. When you start the game, you will be prompted to guess a number between 1 and 200.
2. You have 10 attempts to guess the correct number.
3. After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating whether your guess was too low, too high, or correct.
4. The game will keep track of the number of attempts you've used.
5. If you guess the number correctly within 10 attempts, you win!
6. If you use up all 10 attempts without guessing the correct number, the game will end, and the correct number will be revealed.
